# Numeric Separators

## Stage 3

NOTE: We have found a potential conflict with a potential future feature [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals/issues/7#issuecomment-379311678) and we are [presenting a plan](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/352) in May. In the meantime, we ask implementations to hold before we get more validation. We'll update this section here as soon as we get a closure.

This is a [proposal](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/), the result of a merge between an earlier draft of itself and Christophe Porteneuve's [proposal-numeric-underscores](https://github.com/tdd/proposal-numeric-underscores), to extend the existing [_NumericLiteral_](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#prod-NumericLiteral) to allow a separator character between digits.


## Motivation

This feature enables developers to make their numeric literals more readable by creating a visual separation between groups of digits. Large numeric literals are difficult for the human eye to parse quickly, especially when there are long digit repetitions. This impairs both the ability to get the correct value / order of magnitude...

```js
1000000000   // Is this a billion? a hundred millions? Ten millions?
101475938.38 // what scale is this? what power of 10?
```

...but also fails to convey some use-case information, such as fixed-point arithmetic using integers.  For instance, financial computations often work in 4- to 6-digit fixed-point arithmetics, but even storing amounts as cents is not immediately obvious without separators in literals:


```js
const FEE = 12300;
// is this 12,300? Or 123, because it's in cents?

const AMOUNT = 1234500;
// is this 1,234,500? Or cents, hence 12,345? Or financial, 4-fixed 123.45?
```


Using underscores (`_`, U+005F) as separators helps improve readability for numeric literals, both integers and floating-point (and in JS, it's all floating-point anyway):


```js
1_000_000_000           // Ah, so a billion
101_475_938.38          // And this is hundreds of millions

let fee = 123_00;       // $123 (12300 cents, apparently)
let fee = 12_300;       // $12,300 (woah, that fee!)
let amount = 12345_00;  // 12,345 (1234500 cents, apparently)
let amount = 123_4500;  // 123.45 (4-fixed financial)
let amount = 1_234_500; // 1,234,500
```

Also, this works on the fractional and exponent parts, too:

```js
0.000_001 // 1 millionth
1e10_000  // 10^10000 -- granted, far less useful / in-range...
```


## Examples

(The following examples also appear in the README.md of Babel transform plugin for this proposal.)


### Decimal Literals

```js
let budget = 1_000_000_000_000;

// What is the value of `budget`? It's 1 trillion!
// 
// Let's confirm:
console.log(budget === 10 ** 12); // true
```

### Binary Literals

```js
let nibbles = 0b1010_0001_1000_0101;

// Is bit 7 on? It sure is!
// 0b1010_0001_1000_0101
//             ^
//             
// We can double check: 
console.log(!!(nibbles & (1 << 7))); // true
```

### Hex Literal

```js
// Messages are sent as 24 bit values, but should be 
// treated as 3 distinct bytes:
let message = 0xA0_B0_C0;

// What's the value of the upper most byte? It's A0, or 160.
// We can confirm that:
let a = (message >> 16) & 0xFF; 
console.log(a.toString(16), a); // a0, 160

// What's the value of the middle byte? It's B0, or 176.
// Let's just make sure...
let b = (message >> 8) & 0xFF;
console.log(b.toString(16), b); // b0, 176

// What's the value of the lower most byte? It's C0, or 192.
// Again, let's prove that:
let c = message & 0xFF;
console.log(c.toString(16), c); // c0, 192
```

### Octal Literal

*hand wave emoji*

Octals are great for permissions, but also look better when represented in `0o0000` form. No real benefit with separators here. 


## Specification 

You can see what the specification design looks like [here](spec.md) and a more detailed version [here](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-numeric-separator).

## Background

### Alternative Syntax

Our strawnman strategy is to **start with** a more restrictive rule (i.e. disallow both idioms) and losen it upon later if needed (as opposed to starting more broadly and worrying about backwards compatibility trying to tighten it up later).

In addition to that, we couldn't find good/practical evicence where (a) multiple consecutive underscores or (b) underscores before/after numbers are used effectively, so we chose to leave that addition to a later stage if needed/desired.

### Character

The `_` was agreed to as part of Stage 1 acceptance. 

The following examples show numeric separators as they appear in other programming languages:

- **`_` (Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, Rust, Julia, Ada, C#)**
- `'` (C++)

### Prior art

* [Java7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/underscores-literals.html): multiple, only between digits.

```java
float pi = 	3.14_15F;
long hexBytes = 0xFF_EC_DE_5E;
long hexWords = 0xCAFE_F00D;
long maxLong = 0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffffL;
byte nybbles = 0b0010_0101;
long bytes = 0b11010010_01101001_10010100_10010010;
```

> Note that the first two examples are actually unlikely to be correct in any circumstance.
